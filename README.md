# ACNH Critterpedia

ACNH Critterpedia is a CLI application for interacting with the Critterpedia from Animal Crossing New Horizons. It allows you to see what critters are available to catch at the current moment, as well as searching critters by month and pulling up information on specific critters.

Future functionality is planned to allow adding critters to your personal collection so you can use the Critterpedia to keep track of which critters you still need to catch.

## Installation

To install, run the following command:

    $ gem install acnh_critterpedia

## Usage

After installing, run
    $ acnh_critterpedia
to start the application.

ACNH Critterpedia is an interactive app for interfacing with Animal Crossing New Horizon's Critterpedia. It is for personal use to help you keep track of available critters while you play the game!
